# cap-soil-moisture-v2
Files for the capacitive soil moisture (2 kicad projects and 1 arduino sketch with dependencies)

Electronics
- square1-planecap - the Kicad project for the coplanar capacitive probe. The Gerber files are in ./square1-planecap/print/grbl
- soil-moisture2 - the Kicad project for the soil moisture controller. The gerber files are in ./soil-moisture2/print/grbl

Arduino sketch and dependecies - in sketch-and-deps
- libs - two libraries that would need installing in Arduino-IDE
- doc - an Excel file with the configuration modes
- soil-cap-logic.ino - the sketch - I'll codedoc it some time soon
