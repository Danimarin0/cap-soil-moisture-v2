Before compiling the scketch, you'll need to install the two libraries from the ./libs

- LowPower - https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power
Has some adjustments to make the library compile on ATMEGA168
See http://www.rocketscream.com/blog/forums/topic/sleep_mode_ext_standby-not-declared-on-atmega168/

When I'll have a bit of time, I'll try to codedoc the sketch, it's a promise.
